suppose you've found a meeting room. you arrive there ready to present and find that someone has taken one or more of the chairs!!.
you need to find some chairs quick. check all the other meeting romms to see if all of the chairs are in use. Your meeting room can take up to 8 chairs.
need will tell you how many have been taken. you need to find that many.
Find the spare chairs from the aray of meeting rooms.each meeting room tuple will have the number of occupants as a string.
each occupant is represented by 'X'. the room tuple will also have an integer telling you how many chairs there are in the room. 
you should return an array of integers that shows how many chairs you take form each room in order, up untill you have the required amount. 

Example: [['XXX', 3], ['XXXXX, 6'], ['XXXXXX', 9], ['XXX', 2] when you need 4 chairs. 
output: [0,1,3] // no chairs free in room 0, take 1 from room 1, take 3 from room 2, no need to consider room 3 as you have 4 chairs already. write me a code that helps solve this problem
